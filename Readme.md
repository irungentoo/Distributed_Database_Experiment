# Distributed Trustless Scalable Database Experiment.

This is a distributed database experiment. It is based on the principle that detection of misbehaviors in a system can increase more than linearily the more people participate in the system and that enacting some kind of punishment for bad behavior will deter people from trying which will improve the overall quality of the network.

Everyone keeps saying that transparency is a way to keep big institutions in check, lets check if that concept is good enough to make a crypto currency.

## FAQ

#### Why is it a cryptocurrency?

People are more likely to try to break a crypto currency than a distributed trustless porn storage database or any other application this has.

#### Is it like Bitcoin?

It doesn't use a blockchain and there won't be any wasteful garbage like proof of work.

#### Will it actually work?

I have no idea, that's why it's an experiment.

#### What Crypto does it use?

The signature stuff from libsodium.

#### Is this a joke?

No. A working efficient scalable trustless database would solve a lot of the problems that distributed software has like the "Why does your distributed secure message app have these weird hex strings instead of human readable usernames? I NEED offline messages and device syncing or I won't use it, all the software that farms my info for profit has it so why don't you have it?" problem. I would be very happy for this problem to be solved and since this seems like a possible path I would like to explore it.

#### How do I run it?

Get libuv and libsodium and run build.sh

#### Does it work yet?

No.
